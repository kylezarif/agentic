      "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",

      "raw_model_output": "To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day.**\n   - Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\n2. **Determine how many eggs she uses for breakfast and baking.**\n   - She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.\n   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.\n   - Total eggs used = 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining after she uses some.**\n   - Remaining eggs = Total eggs - Eggs used = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\n\n4. **Determine how much she makes from selling the remaining eggs.**\n   - She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each.\n   - Total earnings from selling eggs = Number of eggs sold \u00d7 Price per egg = 9 \u00d7 2 = $18.\n\nThus, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nFinal answer: Answer: 18",

      "raw_model_output": "To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to add the amounts of blue and white fiber together.\n\n1. The amount of blue fiber needed is 2 bolts.\n2. The amount of white fiber needed is half of the blue fiber, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of bolts of fiber:\n\\[\n\\text{Total bolts} = \\text{blue fiber} + \\text{white fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is 3.\n\nAnswer: 3",

      "question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?",

      "predicted_answer": "70000",
      "raw_model_output": "To find out how much profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the house**: This includes the purchase price and the repair costs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Purchase Price} + \\text{Repair Costs}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increased Value} = \\text{Purchase Price} \\times 150\\%\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increased Value} = 80,000 \\times 1.5 = 120,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the new value of the house**: The new value is the original purchase price plus the increased value.\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Value} = \\text{Purchase Price} + \\text{Increased Value}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the profit**: Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{New Value} - \\text{Total Cost}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\n   \\]\n\nThus, Josh made a profit of $70,000.\n\nFinal answer: Answer: 70000",

      "predicted_answer": "540",
      "raw_model_output": "To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we can break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance for one sprint**: James runs 60 meters in one sprint.\n\n2. **Calculate the total distance for 3 sprints**: Since he runs 3 sprints each time, we multiply the distance of one sprint by the number of sprints:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ meters/sprint} \\times 3 \\text{ sprints} = 180 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total distance for 3 times a week**: Now, since he does this 3 times a week, we multiply the total distance for 3 sprints by the number of days he runs:\n   \\[\n   180 \\text{ meters} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 540 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total distance James runs in a week is 540 meters.\n\nFinal answer: Answer: 540",

      "question": "Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?",

      "predicted_answer": "20",
      "raw_model_output": "To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed required for the entire day for her flock of 20 chickens.\n\n1. Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day.\n2. Therefore, for 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ chickens} \\times 3 \\text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n3. Wendi has already fed her chickens:\n   - 15 cups in the morning\n   - 25 cups in the afternoon\n\n4. We can calculate the total amount of feed given so far:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ cups} + 25 \\text{ cups} = 40 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n5. Now, we need to find out how much feed is left to be given in the final meal:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ cups (total needed)} - 40 \\text{ cups (already given)} = 20 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\n\nFinal answer:\nAnswer: 20",

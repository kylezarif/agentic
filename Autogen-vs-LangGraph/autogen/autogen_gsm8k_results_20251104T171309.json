      "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
      "gold_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",
      "predicted_answer": "18",
      "raw_model_output": "To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day.**  \n   Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\n2. **Determine how many eggs she consumes and uses for baking.**  \n   Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.  \n   Total eggs consumed and used = 3 (breakfast) + 4 (baking) = 7 eggs.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining after consumption and baking.**  \n   Remaining eggs = Total eggs - Eggs consumed and used  \n   Remaining eggs = 16 (total) - 7 (consumed and used) = 9 eggs.\n\n4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs.**  \n   Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each.  \n   Total revenue = Number of eggs sold \u00d7 Price per egg  \n   Total revenue = 9 eggs \u00d7 $2/egg = $18.\n\nThus, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\nFinal answer: Answer: 18",

      "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
      "gold_answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3",
      "predicted_answer": "3",
      "raw_model_output": "To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to add the amounts of blue and white fiber together.\n\n1. **Identify the amount of blue fiber**: The problem states that it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n\n2. **Identify the amount of white fiber**: It states that it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, we calculate the white fiber as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{White fiber} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Blue fiber} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ bolt}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of fiber**: Now we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total fiber} = \\text{Blue fiber} + \\text{White fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is 3.\n\nFinal answer: Answer: 3",

      "question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?",

      "question": "Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?",
      "gold_answer": "If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.\nIf she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.\n#### 20",
      "predicted_answer": "20",
      "raw_model_output": "To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed required for her flock of 20 chickens.\n\n1.

The total amount of feed given so far is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ cups} + 25 \\text{ cups} = 40 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much feed is left to be given in the final meal of the day:\n\n1.

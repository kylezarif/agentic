      "actual_output": "To determine which material would best insulate a house, we need to consider the thermal conductivity of each option. Insulation materials are typically evaluated based on their ability to resist heat flow, which is indicated by their thermal conductivity (k-value). Lower k-values indicate better insulating properties.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA) **Paper**: While paper can provide some insulation, it is not very effective compared to other materials. It has a relatively higher thermal conduc",

      "actual_output": "To determine what causes day and night on Earth, let's analyze each option:\n\nA) **Earth's rotation**: The Earth rotates on its axis approximately every 24 hours. As it rotates, different parts of the Earth face the Sun, experiencing daylight, while the parts that are turned away from the Sun experience night. This rotation is the primary reason we have day and night.\n\nB) **Moon's orbit**: While the Moon does have an orbit around the Earth and affects phenomena like tides, it does not directly ca",

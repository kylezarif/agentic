      "actual_output": "To find out how far the car travels, we can use the formula for distance:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the speed of the car is 60 miles per hour, and the time it travels is 3 hours. Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 60 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 180 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the car travels a total distance of 180 miles.\n\nFinal answer: 180 miles.",
